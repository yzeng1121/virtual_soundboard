Virtual Soundboard
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A web application providing users the ability to use audio sound effects in 
real time for comedic effect.

## About 
This was a random small project I decided to make because I couldn't find a 
website with the meme sounds that I wanted, so I created one from scratch that's
easily customizeable.

Users can customize their own sounds by manually importing their own audio 
files onto the sounds folder and replacing the file paths in the index.html
file.

The fonts were downloaded through the website dafont.com, definitely 
check out for other cool fonts. The sound effects were taken through random 
YouTube videos. The specific board I used is an image of the PreSonus ATOM 
16-pad Performance Controller, which I just downloaded the image off of the 
Sweetwater website.
